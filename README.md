# hw5-calendar

A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of a typical business day. The app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library was utilized in generating the time displayed at the top of the page as well as showing which hour block of time the user is currently in through dynamically updated CSS.
